GPT2 PyTorch<br>
======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================<br>
 It was about the year 1000, and its inhabitants were called the 'wild man,' the 'pure forest,' because the flowers they brought with them were no longer seen. It was like a dream. In my mind, I thought, 'What is this?' And it was a dream. At that time I had no idea of the nature of nature.

I was a little child with a very bad case of epilepsy. I had been told that my parents were very pious and were very pious, and that I would prove myself to them. But I didn't know what to do. I had a bad case of epilepsy. I was very hungry and had to eat the whole day before I could get enough. I was in a state of complete confusion and I thought I was going mad. When I got to the hospital when I was twenty, I was immediately cured.

After that I was very sick. I was very sick. I was sick because I was sick with what I called the 'foul smell,' the 'foul smell' of the flowers in the flowers. And what did I do? I began to think I was going crazy. I thought that I was going mad. I kept thinking that I was going mad. I kept thinking that my friends were going crazy. I kept thinking that I was going mad. I kept thinking that I was going mad.

Then I was a little girl. My parents had been very good to me. My mother had taught me many things that I had never understood. My sister had been very good to me.

I knew, in fact, that what I had done was wrong, and that I could not understand how God could have made me stupid so easily by making me stupid. I had heard that God had made me stupid in a certain way. I knew that he had made me stupid. I had seen things that I had never seen before. It was like a dream. And then I said, 'What is this dream?'

I said, 'This is a dream in my head.' And I came to realize that I had been told that it was a dream.

I knew that God had made me stupid. I knew that he had made me stupid because I was like a child. I knew that I had been told that I was going crazy. I knew that I was going crazy. And I had learned that there was no God and that the only way to be a good man was to be kind to others, and that
